FH3 Mod Platform
================

The shared base for Forza Horizon 3 (Azimuth) mods. Version 1.0.0, mod API 12. It's one DLL under
two names: d3dcompiler_47.dll, which Azimuth up to 1.0.1 loads, and
DWrite.dll, which Azimuth 1.0.1 and later load (1.0.3 loads only this
one). It loads every mod in the fh3-mods folder next to azimuth.exe and
gives them game-text edits, game file and database changes, title-screen
notices, update checks, logging, a way to talk to each other, access to
the game, and shared hooks into its code.

Players: copy DWrite.dll and d3dcompiler_47.dll next to azimuth.exe (the
folder of your Forza Horizon 3 install). If the FH2 platform is already
there as DWrite.dll, copy only DINPUT8.dll instead: both then run, each for
its own game, then start the game: the MODS
tile on the Home tab opens the mods' pages. Mods built on the platform
usually ship it in their own zips too.

Built in: speed and power units of their own (Settings > HUD and
Gameplay, under Units), SELL CAR in the garage's car menu, the upgrade
bridge mods use for garage upgrades, and a proper saving screen when
you Exit to Desktop.
