# FH3 Mod Platform

A mod loader for **Forza Horizon 3** (the Xbox One build on PC, run through the **Azimuth** launcher), with an in-game
**MODS** section, a way for mods to add their own garage upgrades, and a few quality-of-life features of its own.
It is a fork of Trinculo54's [FH2 Mod Platform](https://github.com/Trinculo54/fh2-mod-platform) (MIT), brought to
Forza Horizon 3's code and menus.

The platform is one DLL, **`DINPUT8.dll`**, next to `azimuth.exe`. Azimuth loads it on start (every Azimuth version imports DINPUT8.dll),
and it loads every mod DLL in the `fh3-mods` folder.

## What you get

**For players**

- **MODS in the game's menus.** A MODS tile on the Home tab opens *Installed mods* (switch each mod on or off, open a mod's
  settings), *Updates*, *About* and *All settings* (the *Get Mods* tile is a placeholder and does nothing yet; there is no mod site for FH3). Mods put their own On/Off, slider and choice rows there, in the game's own style.
- **Update checks.** Mods that name their GitHub repo get checked for new releases; the page tells you which one has an update.
- **Custom upgrades in the garage.** Mods can add upgrades to **Garage > Upgrades** (name, stages, prices, icons) that are bought, fitted, stored per
  car and survive Abandon / Modified car prompts like the game's own parts, with a preview on the car in the shop and slider rows on the car's
  Tuning > Springs page.
- **Upgrades stay on your own cars.** The platform keeps track of the car you drive: a car you pick at an event's car select has its upgrades
  from the start, while showcase cars, loaners and AI cars of the same model as yours (one-make races) get none.
- **Speed unit and power unit of their own.** In **Settings > HUD and Gameplay**, under *Units*, two new rows: *Speed unit*
  (Automatic, km/h, mph) and *Power unit* (Automatic, Horsepower, Kilowatts). Metric with km/h *and* horsepower, or Imperial with kW, no longer needs a mod of your own. *Automatic* follows *Units* as before.
- **Sell Car.** In **Garage > My Cars**, a car's action menu gets **SELL CAR** after *Remove car from garage*: a confirmation shows what you get
  (50% of the model's price + 30% of what you paid for its upgrades, both configurable), then the car is removed with the game's own code and the credits are paid.
- **Any controller for the mods** (1.1.0). Mods and hotkeys read pads through XInput, which only lists Xbox-like controllers. The platform also reads the PC's other gamepads (a DualSense or DualShock 4 over USB or Bluetooth, other HID pads) and adds them to what the mods read, so Nitro, Airride, Launch Control and mods' hotkeys work with a controller that is *not* emulated as an Xbox 360 pad, and it hands such a controller (a DualSense, say) to the game as a gamepad when Windows has no Xbox pad of its own. Only the mods get it; the game's own input is untouched. Settings and the log lines: [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) (`fh3-mods\platform.ini` `[input]`).
- **Exit to Desktop** shows the game's own "saving" popup while the game saves, instead of freezing on the garage.
- **No start-up videos**, crash reports that name the mod involved, save snapshots, a log of everything (`fh3-mods\platform.log`).
- Works with [Extra Options](https://github.com/RokkuDayo/ForzaHorizon2_ExtraOptions) (its FH3 build) (the platform recognises it and shares the Mods tile and pages), and without it (the platform mounts the `mediaoverride` folder itself).

**For mod makers**

- A C/C++ API (`include/fh3mod.h`, API version 16, documented in [`docs/api.md`](docs/api.md)): game-text edits, game-file overrides, database patches
  (`add_sql`), string-table keys for FH3's hashed tables, Mods-page rows (On/Off, sliders, choices), hooks and byte patches, hotkeys, commands
  (`fh3mod.exe`), interfaces between mods, sessions, save snapshots, the **upgrade bridge** (`register_upgrade`) and tuning rows (`add_tuning_row`).
- **Hot reload** (1.2.0, off by default): with `fh3-mods\platform.ini` `[dev] HotReload=1`, rebuild your mod while the game runs and press **F9**: the platform shuts the old build down (`fh3mod_shutdown`), switches its hooks off and starts the new one, with the rows, hotkeys and upgrades re-bound instead of added twice. No restart for a change to your mod's logic. See [`docs/writing-a-mod.md`](docs/writing-a-mod.md#hot-reload-change-your-mod-without-restarting-the-game).
- **Documentation for mod makers**:
  - [`docs/api.md`](docs/api.md): every call, starting with a table of everything a mod can use and what works in FH3;
  - [`docs/writing-a-mod.md`](docs/writing-a-mod.md): from an empty folder to a release (project setup, entry point, hooks, files, icons, shipping);
  - [`docs/car-mods.md`](docs/car-mods.md): mods that change the player's car (upgrades, build-time changes, effects while driving); the platform tells
    the player's car from loaners and AI cars of the same model, so mods don't have to;
  - [`examples/hello_mod`](examples/hello_mod/hello_mod.cpp) is the starting point (with `fh3mod_shutdown`), and the mods listed in `writing-a-mod.md` are complete examples.
- What is known about the game's code: [`docs/fh3-game-notes.md`](docs/fh3-game-notes.md) and [`include/fh3game.h`](include/fh3game.h).

## Requirements

| What | Version |
|---|---|
| Forza Horizon 3 on PC with **Azimuth** | the Xbox One release `forza_durango_release_final.exe` of 5 Jun 2018 (exe timestamp `0x5B16ECCA`) |
| Windows 10/11, or Linux under Wine | the platform needs nothing extra; [Wine notes](docs/linux.md) (written for FH2, not tested on FH3 yet) |

The platform recognises the game by its exe header, so it does nothing (and says so in the log) for any other game or build.
It can share an Azimuth folder with the FH2 platform (see [Next to the FH2 platform](#next-to-the-fh2-platform)): each one only acts in its own game and has its own mods folder.

## Installation

1. Close the game.
2. Download the latest zip from the [releases page](../../releases/latest) and copy **`DINPUT8.dll`** next to `azimuth.exe`.
3. Make a folder called `fh3-mods` next to it (the platform makes it on first start) and put mod DLLs in it.
4. Start the game. The title of the platform and its version are in `fh3-mods\platform.log` ("loaded as DINPUT8.dll"); in the game, **Home > MODS** opens the mods' pages.

Mods built on the platform ship it in their own zips, so most players never need to look for it here.

### Requirements

- Forza Horizon 3 on PC through **Azimuth** (tested with Azimuth 1.0.4), the Xbox One build `forza_durango_release_final.exe` of 5 Jun 2018.
- Azimuth must load a `DINPUT8.dll` from its own folder, which it does by default. If another tool's `DINPUT8.dll` (a controller or input tool, say) is already there, the two can't share the name: tell me in an issue, and until then keep the other tool out of that folder.
- Extra Options (`winmm.dll`) is optional; the platform works with and without it, and 0.6.0 is tested.

### Updating from 1.2.x or older

Earlier versions were `DWrite.dll` and `d3dcompiler_47.dll`. **Delete both**, then copy the new `DINPUT8.dll`. If one of them is left, it runs (an older copy can't stand down for the new one), `platform.log` says so, and nothing of the new version is used.
Some mods' own zips still carry the old two files: don't copy them over the new setup.

### Next to the FH2 platform

The FH2 platform (and FH2MP) is `DWrite.dll`, and this one is `DINPUT8.dll`, so they share a folder: leave the FH2 platform's `DWrite.dll` where it is and add `DINPUT8.dll`.
Both run in every game launch, each only for its own game: the FH3 platform loads `fh3-mods` when Forza Horizon 3 starts and leaves every other game alone, and the FH2 platform loads `fh2-mods` for Forza Horizon 2.
`platform.log` names the other platform when it finds one.

### Settings of the built-in features

| File (`fh3-mods\`) | Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `platform-sellcar.ini` | `[Sell] Enabled` | `1` | `0` turns Sell Car off. |
| | `[Sell] BasePercent` | `50` | Percent of the model's price you get (0-100). |
| | `[Sell] UpgradePercent` | `30` | Percent of what you paid for the car's upgrades you get (0-100). |
| | `[Sell] CreditReason` | `1` | The reason code the game records with the credit payment. |
| `platform-units.ini` | `[units] Speed`, `Power` | `0` | The two unit rows (0 = automatic); written by the settings rows. |
| `platform.ini` | `[dev] HotReload` | `0` | `1` loads mods from copies and lets F9 swap rebuilt DLLs in (for mod makers; see Hot reload in the docs). |
| | `[dev] ReloadKey` | `F9` | The key (F1 to F12). |
| `platform.ini` | `[log] Verbose` | `0` | `1` writes the platform's detailed lines to `platform.log` (hooks, shop steps, garage reads, car builds); for bug reports. Problems are always logged. |

Restart the game after editing an ini by hand.

## Uninstalling

Delete `DINPUT8.dll` (and the `fh3-mods` folder). The platform changes no game file on disk: everything
is done in memory and through the `mediaoverride` folder. Cars you sold stay sold.

If you used a mod that adds garage upgrades, remove *that mod* first, keep the platform, start the game once and open the garage:
a save that still names a custom part would crash the game on load without the platform, and the platform repairs such saves when it starts.
Then remove the platform.

## Build

Needs [llvm-mingw](https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw/releases) (clang; the code uses MSVC-style `__try`) and CMake. On Linux or Windows:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

`dist/` then holds `DINPUT8.dll`, the example mod, `fh3mod.exe` and the headers. The version is `VERSION` in `CMakeLists.txt`;
a release tag (`vX.Y.Z`) must match it. See [`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md).
